# The Costmap 2D package implements a 2D grid-based costmap for environmental representations and a number of sensor processing plugins (AI outputs, depth sensor obstacle buffering, semantic information, etc).

# The Behavior Server implements the server for handling various behavior, such as recoveries and docking, requests and hosting a vector of plugins implementing various C++ behaviors. It is also possible to implement independent behavior servers for each custom behavior, but this server will allow multiple behaviors to share resources such as costmaps and TF buffers to lower incremental costs for new behaviors.
